# Tests for non-uniform primary event distributions (dprimary / dprimary_args)
#
# EpiDelays threads the upstream primarycensored arguments `dprimary` and
# `dprimary_args` through `kerlikelihood()` and `parfitml()` so users can
# fit doubly interval-censored data with a non-uniform primary event
# density (e.g. exponential growth during an outbreak). These tests cover:
#
#   1. No-op equivalence: explicit `dprimary = stats::dunif` must give the
#      same log-likelihood as the default path across all families.
#   2. End-to-end recovery under `dexpgrowth`: parameters come back close
#      to the truth when the same primary density used to simulate is
#      passed to the fitter.
#   3. Mismatched primary is materially biased: fitting the same
#      non-uniform data with the default uniform primary returns fits
#      that differ from the matched fit by a meaningful margin, so the
#      argument is not secretly a no-op.
#   4. Error paths: single-interval data and the Monte Carlo branch both
#      reject non-default primary densities with an informative message.
