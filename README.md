EpiDelays: A Software for Estimation of Epidemiological Delays
================
Oswaldo Gressani (<oswaldo.gressani@uhasselt.be>)

**EpiDelays** is a package that can be used to fit epidemiological delay
distributions to interval-censored data. The `parfitml` routine can be
used to fit parametric delay distributions (`gamma`, `lognormal`,
`weibull`, `gaussian`, `skewnorm`) via maximum likelihood. The
`nonparfit` routine uses the nonparametric methodology developed by
Gressani and Hens (2025) to obtain estimates of key epidemiological
delay features without imposing any parametric assumptions. For both
routines, the nonparametric bootstrap is used to compute standard errors
and confidence intervals for often reported epidemiological delay
features.

This package is currently under construction and additional features
will be added in future releases.
